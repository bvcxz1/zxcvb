                      If dark matter is made up of primordial black holes (PBHs) then these black holes should be scattered all over our galaxy. As stars pass behind these PBHs, 
                      their light would get bent around the PBH due to an effect known as gravitational lensing. 
                      Modern space telescopes like GAIA can detect tiny glitches in the apparent trajectories of these stars due to this lensing effect. 
                      The goal of this project is to explore the sensitivity of GAIA to different masses of PBHs. </p>

                      Designed and fully assembled a ‘prototype gravity-wave-aka-light-disturbance-detector’ which included a proportional–integral–derivative controller, 
                      actuator and a phototransistor-based plant on a breadboard. It was used to measure the amplitude of a light-based disturbance introduced in the 
                      system to great precision.

                      Conceptually, the above scheme is similar to what the LIGO experiment uses for the detection of gravitational 
                      waves. In LIGO, the plant + sensor consists of a Michelson-Morley type light interferometer 
                      with the sensor focused on a dark fringe. The feedback controller is tuned precisely to reject ground 
                      based noise injected into the interferometer mirrors, i.e, the error in the feedback look is 0 in the 
                      steady state. Hence, any extra disturbance detected in this loop is inferred to be from the passage of 
                      gravitational waves which move the mirror mass distorting the interferometer arm lengths
